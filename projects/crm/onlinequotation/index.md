  <div class="label">The challenge</div>
  <p>
    A fast-growing home services marketplace (3× YoY growth) was constrained by a
    7–14 day paper-based quotation process. Customers booked with faster competitors,
    and 50% of complaints were tied directly to quote delays.

  <div class="label">The approach</div>

  <p><strong>1. Diagnose before building</strong><br>
    Applied Lean Six Sigma to map the full quotation flow and identify system friction.
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. Make a deliberate build-vs-buy trade-off</strong><br>
    Reused the internal pricing engine and layered a low-code interface to ship in 3 weeks.
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Design for adoption at scale</strong><br>
    Mobile-first PWA, conditional logic pricing, automated workflows, and parallel usage.
  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Scale through people</strong><br>
    Trained 200+ installers and created feedback loops to drive trust and adoption.

  <div class="label">Key learnings</div>

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Speed beats perfection.</strong> Shipping early unlocked revenue before competitors reacted.
  </div>

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Adoption is the real scaling constraint.</strong> Systems scale only when humans trust them.
  </div>

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Low-code is a strategic accelerator.</strong> Reuse beats reinvention under pressure.
