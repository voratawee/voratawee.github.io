<h1>From 14 Days to 1 Hour: Building a Quotation System That Scales</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
Reduced quote turnaround by <strong>96%</strong>, unlocked <strong>$5M in revenue</strong>,
and scaled quoting to <strong>200+ installers</strong> without adding headcount.

  <div class="label">The challenge</div>
  <p>
    A fast-growing home services marketplace (3× YoY growth) was constrained by a
    7–14 day paper-based quotation process. Customers booked with faster competitors,
    and 50% of complaints were tied directly to quote delays.

  <div class="label">The approach — Build for humans, automate for scale</div>

  <p>
    I approached this problem as a <strong>systems constraint</strong>, not a people issue.
    The goal wasn’t to build a perfect tool — it was to remove a revenue bottleneck
    under real operational pressure.
  </p>

  <p><strong>1. Reframe the problem as a systems failure</strong><br>
    Using Lean Six Sigma principles, I interviewed 30+ installers and mapped the entire
    quotation lifecycle end-to-end. The core insight was clear:
    installers wanted to move fast, but the workflow forced manual calculation,
    office callbacks, and multi-day delays.
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. Make a deliberate build-vs-buy trade-off</strong><br>
    A custom-built solution was estimated at 6 months — a timeline the business
    couldn’t afford. I chose to reuse the existing internal pricing engine and
    layer a low-code interface on top, reducing time-to-impact from 6 months to
    3 weeks while preserving future extensibility.
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Design for adoption before optimization</strong><br>
    The system was built mobile-first so installers could quote on-site.
    Conditional logic eliminated manual math, automated workflows removed
    back-and-forth, and a lightweight review step preserved quality without
    slowing execution.
  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Leverage platform scale instead of infrastructure</strong><br>
    By using a cloud-native low-code platform, each installer operated independently
    with parallel usage across 200+ users. Email delivery, storage, and reliability
    were handled by the platform — eliminating DevOps overhead entirely.
  </p>

  <p><strong>5. Close the loop with change management</strong><br>
    I personally trained 200+ installers, created repeatable onboarding materials,
    and ran feedback loops to refine edge cases. Adoption followed once installers
    saw faster quoting, quicker payments, and higher job throughput.

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Speed beats perfection.</strong> Shipping early unlocked revenue before competitors reacted.
  </div>

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Adoption is the real scaling constraint.</strong> Systems scale only when humans trust them.
  </div>

  <div class="learning">
    <strong>Low-code is a strategic accelerator.</strong> Reuse beats reinvention under pressure.
