### Engineer. MBA. Founder.

**From Bangkok to Silicon Valley dreams — building AI for wellness.**

I wasn’t always building AI startups. Seven years ago, I was a warehousing engineer in Bangkok, optimizing supply chains and training factory teams. I loved solving problems, but I wanted to create solutions that could help millions—not just move a metric a few percent.

So I took a leap. I moved to the U.S. for an MBA at Washington University in St. Louis, diving into entrepreneurship and marketing while keeping my engineering roots. New country, new culture, new constraints—those experiences taught me this: meaningful innovation comes from seeing problems through multiple lenses.

During my MBA, I couldn't ignore a crisis hiding in plain sight: 48 million Americans struggling with mental health, most without accessible support. I watched my close friend burn out under stress, with nowhere to turn. The mental health system was broken—too expensive, too stigmatized, too slow.

I believed AI could help. Not to replace therapy, but to act as a first line of defense, helping people manage daily stress before it becomes chronic.

**That’s how BloomPal began**—an AI-powered companion that guides short, science-backed wellness rituals at the right moment. With my technical co-founder, we built models to understand stress patterns, interviewed hundreds of people, iterated quickly, and earned Top-10 recognition at the AI Startup World Cup (St. Louis region). Early testing reached ~80% positive user feedback—and we’re just getting started.

### What sets me apart
- I speak **engineer and investor** fluently.  
- I bridge **technical architecture** and **go-to-market**.  
- I’ve **built products** and **scaled operations** to meaningful revenue.  
- I bring **PMP-level execution** to startup ambiguity.  
- I’m an **immigrant founder** who has navigated systems across countries.

Today, I’m a founder and a mother building products that help people thrive. I’m focused on scaling BloomPal, forming strategic partnerships, and advising teams on practical AI/ML product development.

**From Bangkok to America. Still building. Always open to meaningful conversations.**
