### Engineer. MBA. Founder.

**From Bangkok to Silicon Valley dreams — building AI for wellness.**

I wasn’t always building AI startups. Seven years ago, I was a warehousing engineer in Bangkok, optimizing supply chains and training factory teams. I loved solving problems, but I wanted to create solutions that could help millions—not just move a metric a few percent.

I moved to the U.S. for an MBA at Washington University in St. Louis and dove into entrepreneurship and marketing while keeping my engineering roots. New country, new culture, new constraints—those experiences taught me this: meaningful innovation comes from seeing problems through multiple lenses.

During my MBA, one problem kept showing up: millions struggle with mental health but lack accessible, stigma-free support. I believed AI could help—not to replace therapy, but to act as a first line of defense for everyday stress.

**That’s how BloomPal began**—an AI-powered companion that guides short, science-backed wellness rituals at the right moment. Early testing showed encouraging user feedback, and we’re iterating quickly.

#### Selected highlights
- Launched an online quotations flow that cut lead time from 7–14 days to **< 1 day**, boosting satisfaction to ~90%.
- Built AI-assisted stress-pattern features and conducted 500+ interviews & surveys; ~80% positive user feedback.
- Mentored founders at a regional nonprofit; coaching program improved semifinalist outcomes.
